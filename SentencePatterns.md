adverbial:Adds information(Where?、When?、Why?、How? etc.)  
当存在多个adverbial时，排列顺序如下:  
| Manner  
| Place  
↓ time  

#### SVO
Model:Subject + Transitive Verb + Object  
Object:They're anything that behaves like a noun.  
Example:

##### [A]SVO[A]
Model:Subject + transitive verb + object + adverbial

#### SVC
Model:Subject + Linking verb + subject complement  
Describe:Subject + linking verb + more info about subject  
Linking verbs:  
- appear
- be  
- become
- feel
- look
- seem
- sound
- taste

Complement:usually a noun phrase or adjective phrase,but adverbs and prepositional phrases also fit this pattern.

##### SVCC
Model:Subject + Linking verb + subject complement + adjective complement  
adjective complement:usually prepositional phrases.  
Example:
She was excited about the party.  

#### SVOO
Model:Subject + verb + indirect object + direct object  
- subject + verb +indirect object + direct object  
  
Example:  
We showed **our cousins**(indirect object，省略了介词) **a good time**(direct object).  
> 间接对象往往是接受行为的人，当间接宾语在直接宾语前面时，省略间接宾语前面的介词。  
  
- subject + verb + direct object + prectional + indirect object  
  
Example:  
I tell **secrets**(direct object) **to**(prectional) **my friends.**(indirect object)  
I sing **songs**(direct object) **for**(prectional) **the children.**(indirect object)  
> 通常不会把动词和他的直接对象分开,当间接宾语在直接宾语的后面时，间接宾语前面一般加介词。
